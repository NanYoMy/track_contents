## Motivation
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="/assets/img/myops.png" class="img-fluid" zoomable=true caption="Figure 1. Myocardial pathology segmentation and its challenges. (A) Myocardial Pathology Segmentation: Scar and edema regions are marked in green and yellow, respectively. (B) Challenges of Myocardial Pathology Segmentation: The challenges include multi-center data, missing sequences, and misalignments in multi-sequence CMR images." %}

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Assessment of myocardial viability is essential in the diagnosis and treatment management of MI patients <d-cite key="myops1"></d-cite>. Multi-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance (MS-CMR) images can provide valuable myocardial pathology information, which is important for the diagnosis and treatment management of patients. As shown in Figure 1 (A), balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine sequences present clear anatomical boundaries, while late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted (T2) CMR sequences visualize myocardial scar and edema of MI, respectively.

## Task

The target of this track is to segment myocardial pathology regions, specifically scar and edema, from multi-sequence CMR data. This track seeks innovative solutions to address MyoPS using real-world multi-sequence CMR data. We encourage participants to overcome challenges such as the inclusion of multi-center data, missing sequences for some centers <d-cite key="myops2"></d-cite>, and misalignments in multi-sequence CMRs <d-cite key="myops3"></d-cite>, as illustrated in Figure 1 (B).

The best works, following the precedent of [MyoPS 2020](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/myops20/), will be recognized with awards. A work is assessed based on several key criteria: **Test Results**, **Generalizability of Methodologies** and **Quality of the Manuscript**. The selected papers will be published in our proceedings [see previous proceedings](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-65651-5).

Topics may cover (not exclusively):
- Myocardial Pathology Segmentation
- Cardiac Anatomy Segmentation
- Multi-Sequence Image Registration


## Data

This track will provide data of 250 patients across 7 centers from China, France, and the United Kingdom. The number of CMR sequence among the patients is as follows:

- **145 patients** have three CMR sequences: LGE, T2, and bSSFP.
- **24 patients** have two sequences: bSSFP and LGE.
- **81 patients** have only one sequence: LGE.

The LGE and T2 CMR sequences are respectively delineated with:
- **Scar** (2221)
- **Edema** (1220)

Additionally, we also provide labels for:
- **Left ventricle** (500)
- **Right ventricle** (600)
- **Healthy myocardium** (200)

All clinical data have received institutional ethical approval and have been anonymized to ensure privacy and compliance with ethical standards.

### Data Split

The dataset is divided into three main parts: training, validation, and test sets:

- **Training Set**: All patients from Centers A, B, C, E, F, and G.
- **Validation Set**: 25 patients from Center D.
- **Test Set**: 25 patients from Center D.

### Pre-Processing

In this track, LGE and T2 images are derived from the end-diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. We have therefore extracted the end-diastolic phase of bSSFP (C0) for this track. 
Note that LGE, T2, and C0 are initially unaligned. The data published here come in two versions: one version has been pre-aligned using the [MvMM method](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/zxhproj), and another one has remained unaligned. **The test phase will be based on the version that has been aligned with the MvMM method.**

### Data Format
Each CMR sequence and gold standard label of patients will be provided in the NIfTI format as follows:
- [Patient Identifier]_LGE.nii.gz
- [Patient Identifier]_T2.nii.gz
- [Patient Identifier]_C0.nii.gz
- [Patient Identifier]_gd.nii.gz (gold standard label)

## Metrics

The performance of scar and edema segmentation results will be evaluated byï¼š
- **Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)**
- **Precision (PRE)**
- **Sensitivity (SEN)**
- **Specificity (SPE)**

Note that the track will provide an open platform for research groups to [validate](http://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/eval/scoreboard?track=MyoPS%2B%2B) and [test](http://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/test_submission) their methods. For fair comparison, the test dataset will remain unseen. Participants need to submit their [docker models](http://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/docker_tutorial) to our platform for testing.
